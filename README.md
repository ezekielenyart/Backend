This is a link to a video walkthrough of my application.

In this project, I have created a command-line application with which you can generate a professional readme file by answering a few prompts.

In your terminal, you will run "node index.js", after which the terminal will prompt you for information about your project, including a title, description, and usage information to name a few.

The items in the table of contents also have been linked to their physical sections so that when you click on the item in the table of contents you are jumped to that section of the readme.

Also, an example readme has been generated already and is inside of my github repository.
